# Rek

The word "Rek" comes from the dutch "rekenmachine" which means calculator.
This is a calculator in a REPL form.

The point is to create an interpreter for evaluation of basic mathemetical formules.

This is also a research project to learn how to lex, parse, create an ast and then compute values based on an ast with an evaluation kernel.
Might also add a symbolic kernel to do symbolic calculations like matlab.
